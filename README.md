# Space Rocks

Old Scholl retro space shooter arcade game in WebGL

I made this in 2020, but I didn't have it published until now (2023)

Currently this is not really a complete game. I still want to add some features:

- Particle animation/explosion when the payer ship dies.
- Gamepad support
- Enemies?
- High scores?
- Levels?
- Etc...
- Rewirte some parts of the code.

## Technologies I'm using in this project

### In the browser:

- WebGL for rendering
- AudioContext for generating sound

### For development

- Jekyll for generating the multilingual page

Not sure if Jekyll is the ideal way for doing this. If you know a better, simpler way: Let me know ;)
