# Space Rocks

Old Scholl retro space shooter arcade game in WebGL

I made this in 2020, but I didn't have it published until now (2023)

Currently is not really a complete game. I still want to add some features:

- Particle animation/explosion when the payer ship dies.
- Enemies?
- High scores?
- Levels?
- Etc...
- Rewirte some parts of the code.
